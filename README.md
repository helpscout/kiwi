## Setup

Add the following global environment variables to your build/CI tool:

```
GITHUB_USER = bob_belcher_2019
GITHUB_REPO = baby-you-can-chive-my-car-burger
TOKEN = CV9$Xc]6iZVJRJiE*uV6MooXg
LOCAL_DIR = burger-project
```

##### `GITHUB_USER`

The Github user name of your repository.

##### `GITHUB_REPO`

The Github repository name.

##### `TOKEN`

Your super secret [Github personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/)

##### `LOCAL_DIR`

The directory of your (CI) local directory.

### Github Username/Email

Since Kiwi needs to push to a Github wiki, ensure that your environment's Git has been set up with a username and email:

```
git config --global user.email "bob@bobsburgers.com"
git config --global user.name "bob_belcher_2019"
```

## Usage

Once you have the above ‚òùÔ∏è set up (it's very important!), all you have to do is run:

```
npx @helpscout/kiwi
```

## Example

### Netlify

For [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), you can set the following [build environment variables](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/#build-environment-variables):

```
GITHUB_USER   = bob_belcher_2019
GITHUB_REPO   = baby-you-can-chive-my-car-burger
TOKEN         = CV9$Xc]6iZVJRJiE*uV6MooXg
LOCAL_DIR     = repo
```

The command for Netlify to run can be simple `netlify.sh` file in your project:

```
# Configures the Git name and email for the commits
git config --global user.email "bob@bobsburgers.com"
git config --global user.name "bob_belcher_2019"

# Runs Kiwi
npx @helpscout/kiwi

# Creates an empty page for Netlify to deploy
mkdir public
touch public/index.html
```

With that, you can set up the following:

**Build command**: `sh netlify.sh`
**Publish directory**: `public`
